  - GENERICO: Buscam melhorar a recomenda√ß√£o de musicas, fotos e videos
  - Utilizam o filtro baseado em conteudo e colaborativo
  - N√£o existe muito estudo sobre recomenda√ß√£o de multimidia
  - Tentam resolver esse problema (grandes desafios)
  - N√£o tem muita rela√ß√£o com contexto tbm

  - O trabalho na pratica (n√£o teoria)
  - Focou no feedback e predi√ß√£o das classifica√ß√µes
  - Parece trazer um √≥timo entendimento de contexto e seus algoritmos
  - Foca nos m√©todos de fatora√ß√£o para obter um feedback impl√≠cito
